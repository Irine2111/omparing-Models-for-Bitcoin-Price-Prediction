    "    (I). Pabuçcu, Hakan, Serdar Ongan, and Ayse Ongan. \"Forecasting the movements of Bitcoin prices: an application of machine learning algorithms.\" Quantitative Finance and Economics 4, no. 4 (2020): 679-692.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What venue was the paper published in? Who are the authors? What are their backgrounds? How many times has the paper been cited? (~3-5 sentences)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The paper is published in Quantitative Finance and Economics. The authors are Hakan Pabuçcu, Serdar Ongan and Ayse Ongan. The paper has been cited by 4 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What problem are the authors trying to solve? (~2 sentences)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The problem that the authors tried to solve is whether we can forecast Bitcoin prices at a high degree of accuracy. Also, which machine learning algorithm will have the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why is the problem important (2-5 sentences)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies developed rapidly and have become extremely popular among investors in the global economy. However, chaotic fluctuations exit in the price series of these cryptocurrencies and bring high losses-risks for users. The investigation about the movements of Bitcoin prices could help people to understand more about cryptocurrencies and avoid potential losses-risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What mathematical notation do the authors use and what does this notation mean? This is often most useful represented as a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    n:\tthe number of days accepted as 10\n",
    "\n",
    "    C􏰆t:\tclosing price(HH􏰆 is the highest high)\n",
    "\n",
    "    L􏰆t:\tlow price (LL􏰆t is the lowest low )\n",
    "\n",
    "    H􏰆t:\tHigh price \n",
    "\n",
    "    EMA: \texponential moving average\n",

    "    Up􏰆t and Dw􏰆t: \tupward and downward price change at time t \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make a list of five terms that you do not understand from your paper. For each, do a bit of research and write a brief description of the term. (~2 sentences each.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    (1)Momentum (Mom): an indicator that represents the effect of price changes and presents information on the sustainability of the current trend. If the momentum value is positive, the trend is “upward” and labeled as +1. If the momentum value is negative, the trend is “downward” and labeled as −1. \n",
    "    (2)Stochastic oscillator: an indicator that determines securities’ momentum and identifies the overbought and oversold levels. Range from 0 to 100.\n",
    "    (3)Larry Williams (LW): compares securities’ closing prices and their high-low ranges over time. If the value of an indicator at the time “t” is greater than the value at the time “t−1”, the trend is “upward” and labeled as +1 and if the value of an indicator at the time “t” is lower than the value at the time “t−1”, the trend is “downward” and labeled as −1. \n",
    "    (4)Relative strength index( RSI): determines the overbought or oversold levels of the security by measuring the speed and magnitude of the changes in recent prices. If the RSI value is labeled as -1 when it’s lower than 30 and labeled as 1 when it’s higher than 70.\n",
    "    (5)Artificial neural network( ANN): Algorithm that is commonly used in forecasting price movements. It has multilayer perceptron flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What datasets did the authors use (if any)? Why did they use these datasets? (~2 sentences)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The authors used a continuous and a discrete dataset. Both datasets contain the closing price of every day, highest price, and lowest from 2008 to 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1. What machine learning models did the authors use (if any)? Why did they justify using these? (~2 sentences)\n",
    "    \n",
    "        The authors compared 5 algorithms: Artificial Neural Network because it’s a commonly used algorithm in price movements prediction, Support Vector Machine which minimizes structural risk, Naïve Bayes which is simple to calculate and use compared with other algorithms, random forest which is efficient, and logistic regression which is a popular technique to model the probability of discrete outcomes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\t2. How did the authors know their approach was successful? (~10 sentences)\n",
    "        In order to test the successfulness of the algorithms, the authors imported true/false positive and true/false negative. They calculated accuracy F statistics, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and root absolute error (RAE) of all algorithms. Polynomial and radial basis (Gaussian) Kernel functions are used to determine which algorithm has the highest accuracy statistics. Then, the authors looked for the algorithm that has high accuracy statistics and low error statistics, and this model is the best estimator.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. What evaluation metrics did they use? What do these metrics mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The evaluation metric is accuracy. This means how many results are rightly predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1. What baselines did they compare against?\n",
    "        The result of logistic regression is served as the benchmark against which other algorithms are compared.    \n",
    "\t2. Can you identify a problem with the authors' measure of success?\n",
    "        The result of logistic regression is served as the benchmark against which other algorithms are compared.    \n",
    "8.  Research papers are almost always an improvement, reaction or twist on other research (“prior work”) that others have done before. Of all of the works cited in your paper, what seems to be the most important cited prior work? Explain why that citation seems most important. (4-6 sentences)\n",
    "\n",
    "    I think Felizardo L, Oliveira R, Del-Moral-Hernandez E’s Comparative study of Bitcoin price prediction using WaveNets, Recurrent Neural Networks, and other Machine Learning Methods is the most important prior work. Because this prior work has the same format as the paper, which compares different machine learning methods to each other for their forecasting performances. Both of the 2 papers include neural network and random forest in comparing algorithms other than traditional forecasting models. I think the paper is an extension of the prior work which analysis the algorithms on both continuous and discrete data and imported more technical input parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  Research papers almost always make use of tools, methods and algorithms that have been developed by others. Of all of the works cited in your paper, what citation of a tool, method or algorithm seems most important? Explain why. (4-6 sentences)\n",
    "\n",
    "    I think the method and algorithm cited from Jang & Lee (2018) An Empirical Study on Modeling and Prediction of Bitcoin Prices With Bayesian Neural Networks Based on Blockchain Information. Is the most important. The paper includes Bayesian Neural Networks in the comparison because this prior work shows that this algorithm performs well. Also, the paper imports accuracy statistics and error statistics to analyze the performance of different algorithms which is used in this prior paper. So, I think the paper is largely influenced by this prior work on the algorithm and analyzing methods chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Pick one equation from the paper and explain what it means using a mix of prose and mathematical notation (~5 sentences).\n",
    "\n",
    "    The paper used F statistics to measure imbalanced classification problems. The equation of F statistics is F-Measure = (2 * Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall). Precision is a metric that quantifies the number of correct positive predictions made and is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of true positives and false positives (Precision = TruePositives / (TruePositives + false positives). The recall is a metric that quantifies the number of correct positive predictions made out of all positive predictions that could have been made (Recall = TruePositives / (TruePositives + FalseNegatives)). \n",
    "\n",
    "11. How is your project similar and different from this paper? (4-5 sentences)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Similar to this paper, our project would also analyze different algorithms and compare their performance. We are intended to import logistics regression and neural networks. Also, we planned to use accurate statistics to measure the performances of the algorithms. However, we would also include algorithms that the paper does not cover such as clustering or ARIMA. Also, the dataset we use would be different since we have more recent data.\n"
